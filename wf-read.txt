# Instagram 3.0 Workflow Project - Complete Summary

## Project Overview
We've been building an enhanced Instagram automation workflow (version 3.0) based on your existing Instagram 2.0 workflow. The goal is to create a sophisticated content automation system with advanced features.

## Current Status

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Problems Found:
1. **Node Connection Issues**: Some nodes (AB Testing, Story Generation, Carousel Support) were not properly connected in the workflow
2. **Generate Image Node**: Was missing proper configuration
3. **Analyze Trends Node**: Code was incomplete
4. **AI Model Connections**: Gemini LLM wasn't properly connected to the information extractor nodes

### What Needs Fixing:
1. Recreate workflow with all proper connections
2. Ensure all nodes are properly linked in sequence
3. Connect auxiliary features (AB Testing, Story, Carousel) properly
4. Add Slack node and connect it
5. Ensure Performance Dashboard gets data from all relevant nodes

## Next Steps for New Chat

1. **Create Fresh Workflow**:
   - Use the n8n MCP tools to create a new workflow
   - Copy the JSON structure from the artifact
   - Ensure all connections are properly made

2. **Add Missing Connections**:
   - Connect Generate Content AI → AB Testing, Story Gen, Carousel
   - Connect Log Complete → Email, Slack, Performance Dashboard
   - Connect Gemini AI Model to both AI nodes

3. **Configure Credentials**:
   - SMTP for email notifications
   - Slack OAuth for team updates
   - Ensure all Supabase and Facebook Graph credentials are set

4. **Create Database Tables**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE performance_metrics (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     post_id VARCHAR(255),
     published_at TIMESTAMP,
     content_type VARCHAR(50),
     ab_version VARCHAR(20),
     is_carousel BOOLEAN,
     has_story BOOLEAN,
     caption_length INTEGER,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

5. **Test & Activate**:
   - Run manual test first
   - Check all nodes execute properly
   - Monitor for any errors
   - Activate schedule trigger

## Code Snippets to Use

### Analyze Trends Node (Complete Code):
```javascript
const posts = $input.item.json.data || [];
const config = $('Configure Workflow 3.0').item.json;
const timeAnalysis = {};
posts.forEach(post => {
  if (post.created_at) {
    const hour = new Date(post.created_at).getHours();
    timeAnalysis[hour] = (timeAnalysis[hour] || 0) + 1;
  }
});
let bestHour = 12;
let maxPosts = 0;
Object.entries(timeAnalysis).forEach(([hour, count]) => {
  if (count > maxPosts) {
    maxPosts = count;
    bestHour = parseInt(hour);
  }
});
const dayOfWeek = new Date().getDay();
const contentTypes = ['travel_destination', 'behind_scenes', 'lifestyle_luxury', 'collaboration', 'milestone_celebration'];
const contentType = contentTypes[dayOfWeek % contentTypes.length];
const hashtagCategories = {
  niche: ['#luxurytravel', '#travelmodel', '#wanderlustlife', '#digitalnomadlife'],
  broad: ['#travel', '#model', '#fashion', '#lifestyle'],
  location: ['#bali', '#dubai', '#mykonos', '#maldives'],
  trending: ['#explorepage', '#trending2025', '#viral'],
  branded: ['#ClaraRamosTravel', '#CRLifestyle']
};
return {
  json: {
    optimal_hour: bestHour,
    content_type: contentType,
    hashtag_strategy: hashtagCategories,
    posts_analyzed: posts.length,
    analytics_enabled: config.ENABLE_ANALYTICS,
    version: config.VERSION,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
};
```

## Important Notes
- The workflow JSON is saved in the artifact "instagram-3-workflow"
- All credentials IDs are preserved from the original workflow
- The Poe API token for image generation is included
- Make sure to test image generation first as it's the most complex part

## How to Continue in New Chat

Start your new chat with:
"I need to continue building my Instagram 3.0 automation workflow. I have a project summary with all details. The workflow was partially created but had connection issues. I need to recreate it properly with all features connected."

Then share this summary document to provide full context.
